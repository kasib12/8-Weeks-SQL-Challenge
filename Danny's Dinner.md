## Business Task

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

Danny has provided you 3 different datasets for this case study:

#### Table 1: sales 

| column        | type       |    
| ------------- | ---------- |
| customer_id   | VARCHAR(l) |
| order_date    | DATE       |
| product_id    | INTEGER    |

#### Table 2: menu 

| column       | type       |    
| ------------ | ---------- |
| product_id   | INTEGER    |
| product_name | VARCHAR(5) |
| price        | INTEGER    |

#### Table 3: members 

| column        | type       |    
| ------------- | ---------- |
| customer_id   | VARCHAR(l) |
| join_date     | TIMESTAMP  |

```sql
WITH dates AS

   SELECT *, 
      DATEADD(DAY, 6, join_date) AS valid_date,

)

SELECT d.customer_id,
	SUM(
	CASE WHEN product_name = 'sushi' then price*20
	 WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN d.join_date AND d.valid_date THEN price * 20
	ELSE price*10 END 
	) as total_points
from dates d
join sales s
on d.customer_id = s.customer_id
join menu m
on m.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < d.last_date
group by d.customer_id
